Rounting in MVC:
Routing is the Process through which the Application matches the requested URL path and Executes the related controller and Action

example:
 public class AppointmentController : Controller
 {
   ----//https://localhost:7096/Appointment/Index
     public IActionResult Index()
     {
         return View();
     }
 }

    public class AppointmentController : Controller
    {
      ---//https://localhost:7096/Appointment/Index/1
        public IActionResult Index(int id)
        {
            return Ok("You have entered:{0}"+id);
        }
    }

*The URL(uniform resource locator) pattern for routing is generated and added to Domain name
ex://https://localhost:7096/Appointment/Index/1

===EndPoint=========
add below code in the
app.MapControllerRoute(
    name: "default",
    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");

===Shared folder,ViewImports and viewstart==============
partialView=Its just part of view ex:Footer

_viewImport:In this FILE,you can summarize(abstrct) all using statement that you comminly use in all your view.
_viewStart:It is used ti setup shared-memory(public static variable) across all view files,
ex:the common practice for viewStart is to setup a default value that can overide for layout and viewData/ViewBag dictionary.

======ActionResult===========IActionResult is an interface and ActionResult is an abstract class from which diffrent actionResult inherits.

Type of ActionResult:
1.StatusCode Result ex:Ok()
2.Redirect Results  ex:Redirect("Url")
3.File Results      ex:Return File("FileNAME")
4.Content Result    ex:File Content()
