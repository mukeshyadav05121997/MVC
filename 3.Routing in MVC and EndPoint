Rounting in MVC:
Routing is the Process through which the Application matches the requested URL path and Executes the related controller and Action

example:
 public class AppointmentController : Controller
 {
   ----//https://localhost:7096/Appointment/Index
     public IActionResult Index()
     {
         return View();
     }
 }

    public class AppointmentController : Controller
    {
      ---//https://localhost:7096/Appointment/Index/1
        public IActionResult Index(int id)
        {
            return Ok("You have entered:{0}"+id);
        }
    }

*The URL(uniform resource locator) pattern for routing is generated and added to Domain name
ex:
