====Dependency Injection========================
DI is a technique where one object supplies the dependencies of another object.A DI is a object that can be used as services.

A const is a compile-time constant whereas readonly allows a value to be calculated at run-time and set in 
the constructor or field initializer.

 public class ItemController : Controller
 {
     private readonly ApplicationDbContext _dbContext;

     public ItemController(ApplicationDbContext dbContext)
     {
         _dbContext = dbContext;
         
     }
     public IActionResult Index()
     {
         IEnumerable<Item> items=_dbContext.items;
         return View(items);
     }
 }
